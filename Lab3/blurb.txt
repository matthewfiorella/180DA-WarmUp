I think for our project PyQT is the most
promising graphics library. Based off of this lab,
PyGame seems limited in what it can accomplish. The 
graphics capability of PyGame is mostly dependent on
the programmers skill in defining shapes and positioning
of sprites. The real utility of PyGame is the ease of
start-up as I/O, Game Loops, and window management is 
nicely abstracted. A library like PyQT which offers 
more out of the box graphics functionality while 
still providing window management and easy I/O 
processing is ideal for our project. Buidling our
project will be a time-intensive process, so rapid
start-up time is not as important as ease of graphical
development. This is why PyQT seems to be an idea fit.
