(a) With the google speech recognizer from the python speech processing library it seems I am
able to reliably decode singular words. The latency is quite high unfortunately and a speech processor
that runs offline may be preferable.

(b) I would like the speech recognition to be fairly simple. I think for our game it should be used for
menu operation and powerup activation. I think that the speech recognition would fail if its performance
is especially time sensitive so its role in the game should be more procedural or additive rather
than a core component of gameplay

(c) I think for our game - which presumably is a bomb defuser or basektabll arcade - the accuracy
of the speech recognition is fairly important. Although ideally latency won't be the overriding concern,
correctness will be important for properly incorporating speech recognition. We can lower the threshold 
for accuracy by minimizing the conseuquences of an incorrect speech input, but either potential game idea
requires certain phrases to be said for an action to happen (powerups in basketball, key word in bomb defuser).

(d) I think that we need a good microphone and relatively quiet conditions to ensure that the speech
recognition will work well enough for our game. I think the problem of WiFi can be minimized by using an 
offline speech recognizer
